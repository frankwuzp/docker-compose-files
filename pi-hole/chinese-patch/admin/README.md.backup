Pi-hole[®](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/)'s Web interface (based off of [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE)) provides a central location to manage your Pi-hole and review the statistics generated by FTLDNS[™](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/).

- **Easy-to-interpret**: simple graphs and beautiful colors make Pi-hole's stats easy to understand
- **Responsive**: looks great on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices
- **Useful**: control and configure your Pi-hole with our settings
- **Insightful**: use the query log, audit log, or long-term stats to gain insight into your networks activity

# Installation

The Web interface is enabled by default when you install Pi-hole.

## Post-installation: access the Web interface and gain insight into your network's activity
There are several ways to [access the dashboard](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-access-pi-holes-dashboard-admin-interface/3168):

1. `http://<IP_ADDPRESS_OF_YOUR_PI_HOLE>/admin/`
2. `http:/pi.hole/admin/` (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)
3. `http://pi.hole/` (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)

Once logged in (forgot your password?), you can view your network stats to see things like:

- the domains being queried on your network
- the time the queries were initiated
- the amount of domains that were blocked
- the upstream server queries were sent to
- the type of queries (`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `SRV`, `TXT`, etc.)

## API
Full usage available [here](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863).  can be accessed at `/admin/api.php`. With either no parameters or `/admin/api.php?summary` it returns the following JSON:
```JSON
{  
   "domains_being_blocked":243038,
   "dns_queries_today":2385,
   "ads_blocked_today":414,
   "ads_percentage_today":17.35849,
   "unique_domains":429,
   "queries_forwarded":1537,
   "queries_cached":434,
   "clients_ever_seen":5,
   "unique_clients":5,
   "status":"enabled"
}
```

[There are many more parameters](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863), such as:

- `type & version`
- `summaryRaw`
- `summary`
- `overTimeData10mins`
- `topItems`
- `getQuerySources`
- `getForwardDestinations`
- `getQueryTypes`
- `getAllQueries`
- `enable`
- `disable`
- `recentBlocked`

Together with a token it is also possible to [enable and disable (also with a set timeout) blocking via the API](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/is-there-an-api-command-to-disable-ad-blocking/7693).

The API returns more information (in a slightly different format if `FTL` is running) - it supports a fall-back to the "old" PHP API if `FTL` is not running. Test the type and/or version of the API by using the parameter `type` and `version`.
